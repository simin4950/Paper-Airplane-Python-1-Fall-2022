### HW3 Restaurant ###

# Welcome to Python Kitchen!
# This week you will use your newly learned knowledge of lists, tuples, dictionaries 
# and sorting to create a simulation of a restaurant. 
# Your code will be able to print menus, take orders and more. 

# Here is a list of dishes Python Kitchen provides. It is a list of tuples.
# Each tuple has information of one dish in order: (Number, Name, Price, Origin, Whether is vegetarian)
dishes=[(1,'Salmon Sushi', 30, 'Japan', False), 
        (2,'Pork Dumplings', 25, 'China', False), 
        (3,'Choziro Tacos', 20, 'Mexico', False),
        (4, 'Chickpea Curry', 36, 'India', True),
        (5, 'Apple Pie', 16, 'USA', True),
        (6, 'Jollof Rice', 18, 'Nigeria', False),
        (7, 'Dolma', 45, 'Azerbaijan', False),
        (8, 'Vegetable Pho', 25, 'Vietnam', True),
        (9, 'Kvass', 12, 'Russia',  True),
        (10, 'Luau', 30, 'Samoa', True)]

# TODO: Put the dishes into this dictionary. The key of the dictionary is the dish's name, the value is the dish's price.
# Example: Salmon Sushi: 30
# USE LOOPS: Think about how you can use loops to automate this process for you instead of hardcoding all the dishes

#FUNCTIONS
def print_menu(dishes):
    """
        print_menu() function should print the menu.
        
        You will iterate through the list dishes and print the dish, origin and price in a readable format. 
        If you directly print the list or the tuples, it will be too messy. 
        
        Embed it into text so you get something like: 
        Example: Sushi   origin: Japan   price: 30

    # Complete this function and make sure to remove the "pass" statement
    pass 

def print_vegetarian_menu():
    """ 
        print_vegetarian_menu() function should list vegetarian options in the menu.
        This is indicated by the True/False in the last tuple of the list 'dishes'.

    pass

def print_dishes_ordered_by_price():
    """
        print_dishes_ordered_by_price() function will sort the menu in the order of price (cheap to expensive).
        
        People who want to save money might want the menu printed in order of price, from cheapest to most expensive. You will have to sort the dishes by bubble sort.
        1)First make a copy of the list dishes to sort. Do not sort the original list.
        2)Code a bubble sort algorithm
        3)Print the dishes in the format you used in the first two functions

    pass

def add_dish():
    """
        add_dish() function adds an additional dish to the menu.
        
        In this function you will add a new dish to the menu. 
        You will need many input() statements to get the dishâ€™s name, price, origin, whether it is vegetarian. 
        Then use the inputs to create a tuple for the new dish, and insert the tuple into the list dishes. Last, call the print_menu() function to see your new menu. 
        
        ** Tips: convert the inputs into the right format
        The tuple is (Number, Name, Price, Origin, Whether is vegetarian). 
        What is the number for the new dish? Can you use the len() function?

def apply_discount(price,percentage):
    """
        apply_discount() function takes two arguments, total price and percentage, and returns final price
        
        Use a lambda function to apply the discount percentage. 
        If the price is 100 and discount is 0.2, the discounted price should be 100*(1-0.2)=80. 
        Return the discounted price.

def get_order():
    """
        get_order() function takes customer's order and does the following
        
        1. print('Type the number of the dish you want to order and enter. If you are done, type 0 and enter.') 
            The user will input dishes one by one, by entering the number of the dish.
        2. Use a while loop to collect the dishes and put them in a list. The while loop should end if the user enters 0. 
            **Tips: convert the input numbers into integers
        3. Add up the prices of all the dishes. Use a for loop to iterate through the list of dishes the user ordered. 
        4. Print all the dishes the user ordered.
        5. Return the list of dishes the user ordered.
        6. Return the final price
